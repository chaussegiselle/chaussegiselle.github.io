        <i>Art direction inpires us</i><br>
        <p>Last year, this marked my 400th artwork for my portfolio.  I wished to try something both dynamic yet calming.  I drew an Asian palace amidst a stormy sea, the Palace of Midnight.  But the first time I painted it, something was missing.  After working with the sea, I was pleased to see the white streaks gave the sea motion and life!</p>
        <span><u><b>Shadows Price of our Sins</b></u></span><br>

        <i>Art direction encourages us</i><br>
        <p>In 2014, I played a PC game for Halloween called "Shadows Price of our Sins".  The game gave me a nice playing experience.  Yet, I felt the storyline was lacking in more Halloween themes, asides from ghosts, jack'o'lanterns and the macabre.  So at least two years ago, I thought up halloween-themed curses for the ghosts, each one suited to their respective past wrongs.  From right to left: <br> <b>Master Jack</b> The fiery-looking young man was the only ghost who bore a notable curse, one Jack.  In life, he was master of the house and fiancee to a kindly young lady.  But another woman, a maid named Talula, wanted Jack to herself. She cursed Jack to seemingly fall in love with her, sending his poor bride to drown herself in the nearby lake.  In an attempt to revive her, Jack turned to the dark arts, but at a high price.  Seven of his closest servants shared his curse and also became ghosts, albeit normal-looking specters.  <br> <b>Morgan</b> On the night before Jack's bride killed herself, Morgan the fisherman spotted a mysterious figure take his boat, whilst carrying an unconcious woman in a white dress.  Morgan ignored his instincts and turned a blind eye to the suspicious activity.  When he heard of the suicide, poor Morgan realized it was his fault.  He becomes a skeleton bobbing for apples, to signify how he'll forever "bob" the lake for a second chance to redeem himself. <br> <b>Keiko</b> Before the bride's untimely death, Keiko the gardener was tending her garden to grow the best flowers for the bride's bouquet.  But a mysterious cloaked figure approached her with a request.  They wanted the spices needed to make a forever-sleep potion.  When Keiko refused, the mysterious figure demonstrated their power by making all of her flowers wilt, and sprout weeds and thorns in thier place.  In Keiko's home country, flowers are believed to have souls.  Desperate to save her "babies", Keiko complied and gave the stranger what they wanted.  She becames a pumpkin jack'o'lantern perched on a wilting sakura tree to signify how she valued the life of plants over the life of one person.<br> <b>The Priest</b> The local priest in charge of the nearby church took pity on Jack, for despite the rumors, the young man did indeed love and miss his late bride.  So against his beliefs, the priest offered a book on black magic.  One such spell offered a way to revive the dead, via a ritual to be performed on Hallow's Eve.  The ritual involved the Sword of Light, using it to summon the demon Samhein, and trading the sword (along with seven other souls) for the life of a dead loved one.  Ultimately, something went terribly wrong during the ritural.  Henceforth, Jack and his servants were cursed. As a ghost, the Priest has regretted ever giving the book on black magic.  I made him a gargoyle because the symbolism is two fold.  First, it suits the priest's motif of being part of the church.  Second, it's been said that gargoyles were orginally built to <i> represent</i> the sins of the world, not fight it. <br> <b>The Miller</b> Would you believe this repulsive arachnid used to be a handsome, crafty young miller?  In his previous life, he was in love with Jack's fiancee, and adored her from afar.  Days before Jack was to wed his bride, a mysterious stranger approached the miller and made a deal.  If the miller spread rumors about Jack cheating on his beloved, then the bride would call off the marriage and fall into the miller's arms instead.  Needless to say, the miller took the deal and wasted no time spreading lies and gossip about Jack's "infidelity".  Instead, the miller was shocked to learn the bride he so wished to marry had drowned herself.  I made him a spider to represent how he "wove lies", and how his dishonesty made him just as ugly.  And wouldn't you know, he's also a black widow spider to represent how he was cheated of his girl. <br> <b>Grant</b> This headless blacksmith once bore the face of Grant, Jack's trusted blacksmith.  Grant was so in love with Talula that it never occured to him that maybe she had <i>something</i> to do with Jack's bride drowning.  One night, Talula so tenderly asked Grant to forge a replica of the sword of light.  Blinded by love, Grant did as he was told, hoping the task would win over Talula.  The night of the ritual was upon them, and Jack offered Samhein the Sword of Light.  But to his shock, the sword he possessed was a fake!  Angered by the forgery, Samhein punished Jack, and the rest is history.  I made Grant a headless horseman, not just because he works with horses, but because he didn't use his head. <br> <b>Rude the Cook</b> This feline cook used to make all of Jack's meals.  On the night before Jack's wedding, a mysterious stranger came to Rude with a basket of strange herbs and asked her to make a forever-sleep potion with them.  When she was threated with her life, Rude proved far more compliant that Keiko and fearfully cooked the brew.  I drew Rude as a sheepish black cat to signify how she was a "scaredy-cat".<br><b>Nanny</b> In life, she was Talula's mother and Jack's Nanna. She suspected her daughter was up to no good all this time.  It was her who learned she drugged Jack's bride with the forever-sleep potion and drowned her to make it look like suicide.  But before she could tell the truth, Talula cursed her own mother so that if she divulged her secret to anyone, bad things would happen to them.  I made her a scarecrow as a symbolism of how her mouth was figuratively sown shut.</p>
        
        <span><u><b>Callaghan Father</b></u></span><br>
        <img src="callaghans.jpg" alt="Callaghan Father"><br>
        <i>Art direction moves us</i><br>
        <p>Two years ago, I was inspired to work on a "Big Hero 6" artwork of Professor Callaghan for Father's day.  I had heard it said that Professor Callaghan had a military background.  Being a military brat myself, I thought what it must've been like for Abigail when her father was DUY from time to time.  I drew this while listening to "Suddenly" from "Les Miserables".  It suited the Father's day theme of the story, the close bond Abigail and Callaghan shared as father and daughter.  I even modeled Callaghan's army jacket after my Dad's own jacket.  I cried while I drew this heart-warming piece.  There came a moment where I was conflicted between leaving well-enough alone or outlining the whole thing with ink marker.  Thankfully, I had tracing paper, so I could wiegh whether inking the outline was worth it.  From what I saw, outlining it took away from the grace and delicacy of this heartfelt moment.</p>
        <span>The Importance of Marriage</span><br>
        <img src="importanceofmarriage.jpeg" alt="Marriage"><br>
        <i>Art direction chooses right</i><br>
        <p>Gordon B. Hinkley posthumously inspired this masterpiece.  One Wednesday in religion class, we listened to a beautiful lecture about marriage between a man and a woman.  And a video on Gordon B. Hinkley topped it all off.  Recently, I have been into a movie called "Kubo and the Two Strings", and I was prompted to draw a picture of the marriage between the main character's mother and father.</p>
